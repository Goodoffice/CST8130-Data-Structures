# CST8130-Data-Structures
All the labs and assignments in this course.

Learn to use a variety of data structures and associated processing algorithms to manage massive amounts of
data. Explore concepts using Object-Oriented Programming (in Java). Implement some solutions using first
principle coding and others using predefined Collection and Map classes. Master techniques to assess the relative
performance of alternative solutions (Big-O analysis) and make well-reasoned choices of selected data structures.
